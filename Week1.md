## My Goals

1. Debugging

- it's important to have bug fee code

## Plan

:white_check_mark: ~~ I will re do the exercises from the workshop ~~
:white_medium_square: I will try to solve the bonus exercises using the makers debugging mantra

- Tighten the loop (find the exact line the bug is coming from)
- Get visibility (use p to inspect everything to help you home in on the exact line)
