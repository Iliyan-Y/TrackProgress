# Day 1

## Goals

1. Debugging

- it's important to have bug fee code

## Plan

1. I will re do the exercises from the workshop
2. I will try to solve the bonus exercises using the makers debugging mantra

- Tighten the loop (find the exact line the bug is coming from)
- Get visibility (use p to inspect everything to help you home in on the exact line)
