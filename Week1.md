## Goal 1

# Debugging

- it's important to have bug fee code

## Plan

1. :white_check_mark: ~~I will re do the exercises from the workshop~~
2. :white_check_mark: ~~I will try to solve the bonus exercises using the makers debugging mantra~~

- ### The Mantra
  - Tighten the loop (find the exact line the bug is coming from)
  - Get visibility (use p to inspect everything to help you home in on the exact line)

## Self-Assessment

I managed to finish all the challenges. Doing that I definitely get to understand better the process of tightening the loop and getting visibility but I feel like more practice is needed.

## Goal 2

# Practice TDD

- it's essential skill for being sure your code is working as expected.
- Helps to have bug free code.

  2.1. :white_check_mark: ~~Understand better how to raise errors and exceptions~~

  2.2. Understand better the mocking process in RSpec

## Plan

1. :white_check_mark: - ~~Attend the TDD Workshop~~
2. :white_medium_square: - Re do the exercises from the workshop
3. :white_check_mark: - ~~Go back and re do exercise 12 from Boris Bike challenge.~~
4. :white_medium_square: - Read the materials about TDD in week 1 outlines
5. :white_check_mark: - ~~Read about doublers (mocking) in RSpec~~
   - 5.1. Quick verification:
     - Mocks and stubs are not the same thing
     - Stubs (doublers) are used when we want to receive predicted output
     - It's good practice to use stubs and mocks **to isolate unit tests**, no matter what happen to the relevant objet the test will pass.

## Self-Evaluation

I feel much more confident about writing the tests for RSpec and I'm understanding better the concept of TDD.
I feel confident using simple test doubles for creating isolated unit tests, and the purpose of it. I need to
have a look how to use them for more complicated cases and understand better the difference between doubles,stubs and mocks.
