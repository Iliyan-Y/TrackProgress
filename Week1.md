## Goal 1

# Debugging

- it's important to have bug fee code

## Plan

1. :white_check_mark: ~~I will re do the exercises from the workshop~~
2. :white_check_mark: ~~I will try to solve the bonus exercises using the makers debugging mantra~~

- ### The Mantra
  - Tighten the loop (find the exact line the bug is coming from)
  - Get visibility (use p to inspect everything to help you home in on the exact line)

## Self-Assessment

I managed to finish all the challenges. Doing that I definitely get to understand better the process of tightening the loop and getting visibility but I feel like more practice is needed.

## Goal 2

# Practice TDD

- it's essential skill for being sure your code is working as expected.
- Helps to have bug free code.

  2.1 Understand better how to raise errors and exceptions

## Plan

1. :white_medium_square: - Attend the TDD Workshop
2. :white_medium_square: - Re do the exercises from the workshop
3. :white_medium_square: - Go back and re do exercise 12 from Boris Bike challenge.
4. :white_medium_square: - Read the materials about TDD in week 1 outlines
